# Threat model

## Scope

This threat model covers npm request parsing and registry metadata retrieval. Policy evaluation, approvals, cache, diff scanning, and GitHub reporting will extend it in later milestones.

## Assets

- developer workstation and repository integrity;
- source code and repository metadata;
- environment variables and package-registry credentials;
- the integrity and availability of AgentHawk reports;
- the distinction between direct evidence and unverified metadata.

## Trust boundaries

Package specifications, registry URLs, registry responses, redirects, HTTP status codes, metadata strings, and repository configuration are untrusted. The npm registry is an evidence source, not a trust authority. AgentHawk's normalized internal model is trusted only after schema validation.

## Abuse cases and mitigations

| Threat | Mitigation | Residual risk |
|---|---|---|
| Spec smuggles a URL, Git ref, alias, or local path | Parse/classify before provider access | npm grammar evolves; unsupported valid forms may require review |
| Control characters or whitespace alter logs/requests | Reject them during parsing | Unicode confusables require later policy handling |
| Registry URL leaks embedded credentials | Reject username/password components | External proxy configuration is outside this boundary |
| Redirect escapes to an unsafe protocol | Manual bounded redirects; validate every target | HTTPS endpoint itself may be malicious |
| Provider hangs or streams indefinitely | Abort timeout and byte-counted stream reads | Network resource use exists within the configured bounds |
| Provider returns huge, malformed, or non-JSON data | Content-length and streaming limits, UTF-8 and JSON validation | Runtime/parser vulnerabilities remain possible |
| Provider error becomes implicit success | Stable typed failure results | Policy response is implemented in a later milestone |
| Hostile body or exception leaks secrets | Fixed diagnostic messages; never include bodies, URLs, headers, or caught details | Host-level logs outside AgentHawk are not controlled |
| Lifecycle script executes during inspection | Read script names only; never install or execute | Malicious code without lifecycle scripts is not detected |
| Metadata claims a false repository or integrity value | Treat as registry evidence, not proof of benignness | Independent verification is deferred |

## Unsupported claims

A successful provider result does not mean a package is safe, benign, maintained, uncompromised, or free of vulnerabilities. It means the configured registry returned a validated metadata shape for the selected coordinate at evaluation time.
